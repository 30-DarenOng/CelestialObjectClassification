    1. Spatial Distribution: The three classes appear to be well distributed across the sky in terms of Right Ascension and Declination. There doesn't seems to a specific region of the sky where one class is more prevalent.

    2. Redshift distribution: It appears that stars tend to have a lower redshifts, meaning they are generally closer to us. Galaxies show a wider range of redshifts, indicating a mix of nearby and distant galaxies. Quasars on the other hand tend to have higher redshifts, suggesting that they are some of the most distant objects in the dataset.

    3. Class overlap: There are some overlaps in the redshift ranges of the different classes, particularly between galaxies and quasars. This suggests that redshift alone is not sufficient to distinguish between the different classes.
